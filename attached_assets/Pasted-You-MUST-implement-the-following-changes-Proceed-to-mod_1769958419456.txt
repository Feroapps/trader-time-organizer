You MUST implement the following changes. Proceed to modify files. No placeholders. Keep changes minimal and safe.

GOAL:
1) Remove the “Ad Required” blocking flow BEFORE saving an alert.
2) Save alerts immediately, then show an OPTIONAL support modal offering a Rewarded Ad.
3) Keep the Eye icon “pairs reveal” gated behind a Rewarded Ad (unlock flow).
4) Centralize all ad calls through client/src/utils/adService.ts.
5) Add Capacitor-native bridge calls for Android Rewarded Ads with a safe web fallback (existing setTimeout stub).
6) Do NOT add a “Don’t show again” option. Only two buttons.

FILES & REQUIRED CHANGES:

A) client/src/components/AdRequiredModal.tsx
- Keep it as a generic reusable modal (title/message/continue/cancel props).
- Ensure labels can be customized per usage.

B) client/src/screens/Home.tsx
- Locate current “Save Alert ad prompt” using adModalOpen and “Ad Required”.
- Change save flow:
  - On Save: perform save immediately (no ad gating).
  - After successful save: open a new modal (reuse AdRequiredModal) with:
    Title: "Alert saved successfully"
    Message: "If you’d like to support the development of Trader Time Organizer, you can watch a short ad. Watching the ad is optional and won’t affect your alerts."
    Buttons: Primary: "Support & Watch", Secondary: "Not now"
  - Primary button calls adService.showRewardedAd(), then closes modal, then show a brief thank-you toast/message.
  - Secondary closes modal only.
- Locate Eye icon / pairs reveal prompt.
  - Update text to:
    Title: "Unlock pairs"
    Message: "Watch a short ad to unlock the strongest trading pairs for this session."
    Buttons: "Continue" / "Not now"
  - Continue calls adService.showRewardedAd(), then reveal pairs.

C) client/src/screens/DayView.tsx
- Same save flow change as Home:
  - Save immediately
  - After save, show the same optional support modal (2 buttons only)
  - Support & Watch triggers adService.showRewardedAd() then thank-you

D) client/src/utils/adService.ts
- Current implementation is stubbed with setTimeout. Keep web fallback.
- Add Capacitor detection and a native bridge call:
  - If running on Capacitor Android and a plugin is available, call it for rewarded ads.
  - Else fallback to stub setTimeout.
- Provide:
  - async showRewardedAd(): Promise<void>
  - (optional) async showInterstitialAd(): Promise<void> (keep stub)
- Make sure showRewardedAd resolves after ad closes, rejects on error.

CAPACITOR PLUGIN (ADD):
- Create a Capacitor Android plugin under android/app/src/main/java/... (choose a reasonable package name consistent with the project)
- Plugin name: RewardedAds
- Methods:
  - load(options: { adUnitId: string })
  - show(): resolves when reward earned OR ad closed (include a boolean in the resolve payload e.g., rewarded: true/false)
- Use Google Mobile Ads SDK RewardedAd.
- Initialize MobileAds if needed.
- Ensure calls are safe if ad is not loaded: auto-load then show, or return a clear error.
- Expose plugin to the web layer via Capacitor (add the needed registration).

CONFIG:
- Use these IDs (hardcode for now; we will refactor later):
  App ID: ca-app-pub-9912951398967782~9777013433
  Rewarded Ad Unit ID: ca-app-pub-9912951398967782/8731525076

OUTPUT:
- After changes, provide:
  1) A concise list of modified/created files
  2) Where to paste App ID in AndroidManifest (if not already present)
  3) How to test: click Save -> saved -> optional modal -> Support & Watch
     and Eye icon -> Unlock pairs -> rewarded -> show pairs

Important constraints:
- Do NOT block saving behind ads.
- Do NOT add “Don’t show again”.
- Do NOT add any new ad placements beyond these two flows.
