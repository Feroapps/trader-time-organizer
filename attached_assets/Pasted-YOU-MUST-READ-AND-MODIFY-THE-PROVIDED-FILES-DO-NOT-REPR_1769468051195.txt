YOU MUST READ AND MODIFY THE PROVIDED FILES. 
DO NOT REPRINT FILES UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE.

========================================
OBJECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1) REMOVE SNOOZE COMPLETELY FROM THE APP.
2) USER-CREATED ALARMS MUST RING FOR 120 SECONDS UNLESS USER STOPS THEM.
3) SESSION / FIXED ALERTS MUST BE VERIFIED AS SCHEDULED CORRECTLY.

========================================
ABSOLUTE RULES (HARD FAIL IF BROKEN)

- DO NOT refactor unrelated code.
- DO NOT change file paths.
- DO NOT change package name.
- DO NOT add new features.
- DO NOT invent logic that is not present.
- DO NOT say “already correct” without PROVING IT.
- DO NOT reprint unchanged files.
- If a file does NOT change → DO NOT output it.
- If you output a file → it MUST contain a REAL, NECESSARY change.

========================================
STEP A — SNOOZE REMOVAL (END-TO-END)

You must PROVE snooze is gone by code inspection, not claims.

FILES TO CHECK AND MODIFY ONLY IF NEEDED:

1) client/src/types/Alarm.ts
- If ANY snooze field exists → remove it.
- If no snooze exists → DO NOT OUTPUT THIS FILE.

2) client/src/components/AlertModal.tsx
- Verify NO snooze UI exists.
- Verify snooze is NOT written into CreateAlarmInput.
- If already clean → DO NOT OUTPUT THIS FILE.

3) client/src/storage/alarmsRepo.ts
- Verify create/save logic does NOT expect snooze.
- If unchanged → DO NOT OUTPUT THIS FILE.

4) client/src/utils/userAlarmPlugin.ts (TypeScript)
- scheduleUserAlarmNative MUST NOT accept or forward snooze.
- If signature already clean → DO NOT OUTPUT THIS FILE.

5) android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/UserAlarmPlugin.java
- scheduleAlarm MUST ignore snooze entirely.
- Only ONE alarm via AlarmManager.
- If no snooze handling exists → DO NOT OUTPUT THIS FILE.

========================================
STEP B — 120s RING GUARANTEE (ANDROID ONLY)

FILE:
android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmSoundService.java

REQUIREMENT:
- Alarm rings MAX 120000 ms OR until STOP is pressed.
- NO snooze. NO re-trigger loop.

- If ALARM_TIMEOUT_MS = 120000 and stop logic is correct → DO NOT OUTPUT FILE.
- If not → FIX IT and OUTPUT FULL FILE.

========================================
STEP C — SESSION / FIXED ALERTS VERIFICATION

FILE:
client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts

TASK:
- ANALYZE rescheduleAllAlarms().
- ANSWER BY CODE, NOT WORDS:
  - Are isFixed === true alarms scheduled?
- If YES → DO NOT CHANGE LOGIC.
- If NO → FIX IT so ALL enabled alarms are scheduled.

RULE:
- If logic already correct → DO NOT OUTPUT FILE.
- If you change ONE line → OUTPUT FULL FILE.

========================================
OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)

For EACH MODIFIED FILE ONLY:

--- FILE: <exact path> ---
<full updated content>

NO EXPLANATIONS.
NO SUMMARIES.
NO DUPLICATE FILES.
NO UNCHANGED FILES.

If you output zero files, that means the system was already correct.
If you output a file, it MUST contain a meaningful change.

========================================
FAIL CONDITIONS (AUTOMATIC FAILURE)

- You output unchanged files.
- You claim correctness without code proof.
- You modify unrelated logic.
- You add comments instead of fixes.
- You respond with partial files.
