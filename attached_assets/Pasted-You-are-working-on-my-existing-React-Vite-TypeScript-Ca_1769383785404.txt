You are working on my existing React + Vite + TypeScript + Capacitor Android app (trader-time-organizer).

NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARDRAILS (must comply exactly):
- DO NOT change capacitor appId, Android applicationId/packageName, or any Android namespace/package identifiers.
- DO NOT clear, reset, migrate-by-wiping, or otherwise touch IndexedDB/localStorage user data.
- DO NOT delete, recreate, or “rebuild” user alerts, notes, or existing stored records.
- DO NOT change the alert scheduling logic, repeat logic, UTC/local conversion, or any business logic.
- ONLY make the minimum changes required for: (1) sound assets replacement, (2) correct channelId usage per sound, (3) stop preview overlap, (4) open Android notification settings for Custom sound.
- If any change is not strictly necessary for the sound issues, DO NOT do it.

CURRENT STATUS / BUGS (not solved):
1) In-app preview sounds still overlap (singleton preview not working).
2) On Android, changing the alert sound inside the app does NOT change the notification sound. The notification sound remains the same, and notification audio is consistently delayed.
3) “Custom” sound option is broken: the user cannot add/select any custom sound. Pressing the Custom option does NOT open any Android/system UI where the user can choose a sound. There must be a working way to open Android notification settings so the user can set the Custom channel sound from the system.

A) Audio assets — delete ALL except “original”, then replace with my uploads
1) In the repo, delete ALL built-in alert sound files EXCEPT the “original” sound asset.
   - This includes:
     - Any web assets under public/ (e.g., public/sounds/*) and duplicates under src/assets or elsewhere.
     - Any Android raw resources under android/app/src/main/res/raw/ (delete classic/chime/bell/ping/tone files).
2) Keep only the “original” sound file as baseline.
3) I will upload the replacement sound files to you. Once uploaded, you MUST:
   - Add them to BOTH:
     - Web preview assets path (e.g., public/sounds/) used by the sound picker.
     - Android raw resources: android/app/src/main/res/raw/
   - Use these exact Android filenames (lowercase, underscores, no spaces):
     - alert_original.mp3
     - alert_classic.mp3
     - alert_chime.mp3
     - alert_bell.mp3
     - alert_ping.mp3
     - alert_tone.mp3
   - Ensure the web preview filenames/paths match the soundId mapping used by the UI.

B) Android notification channels — sound must actually change for existing installs + fix delay
Critical Android rule: Notification channel sound is IMMUTABLE once the channel exists.
Therefore, if channels were created previously with wrong sounds, changing sound “in-app” will not affect them unless we schedule notifications into NEW channels.

Implement this exact approach:
1) Do NOT attempt to modify sound on an existing channel.
2) Create one channel per sound + one Custom channel:
   - alerts_original  ("Alerts - Original") sound: "alert_original"
   - alerts_classic   ("Alerts - Classic")  sound: "alert_classic"
   - alerts_chime     ("Alerts - Chime")    sound: "alert_chime"
   - alerts_bell      ("Alerts - Bell")     sound: "alert_bell"
   - alerts_ping      ("Alerts - Ping")     sound: "alert_ping"
   - alerts_tone      ("Alerts - Tone")     sound: "alert_tone"
   - alerts_custom    ("Alerts - Custom")   NO custom sound set (system-managed)
3) If ANY of the above channels already exist on user devices and are “stuck” with wrong sound, you MUST NOT delete them.
   Instead, create VERSIONED replacement channels and use them for all NEW schedules:
   - alerts_original_v2, alerts_classic_v2, alerts_chime_v2, alerts_bell_v2, alerts_ping_v2, alerts_tone_v2, alerts_custom_v2
   Then schedule notifications using these v2 channelIds based on selected sound.
   - IMPORTANT: Do NOT migrate, delete, or rewrite existing stored alerts. Only alter channelId at schedule-time.
4) Ensure EVERY scheduled local notification (weekly repeating + custom date/time) includes channelId dynamically based on selected sound:
   - original -> alerts_original_v2
   - classic  -> alerts_classic_v2
   - chime    -> alerts_chime_v2
   - bell     -> alerts_bell_v2
   - ping     -> alerts_ping_v2
   - tone     -> alerts_tone_v2
   - custom   -> alerts_custom_v2
5) Investigate and fix the notification sound delay WITHOUT changing app logic:
   - Confirm raw resources exist and names match exactly (sound: "alert_xxx" without extension).
   - Confirm the scheduled notification uses the expected channelId.
   - Keep notification importance/visibility sane and consistent (do not introduce new behaviors).

C) Fix overlapping in-app preview (singleton, mandatory)
1) Sound picker preview must use a SINGLETON HTMLAudioElement:
   - On play: stop any currently playing preview (pause + currentTime=0), set src, play.
   - On modal close/unmount: stop preview immediately.
2) Ensure “Original” does NOT keep playing when switching to another sound.

D) Fix “Custom” sound UX (must open Android settings)
1) The Custom option must NOT pretend it can “upload” a sound inside the app.
   - The correct behavior: user sets the Custom channel sound from Android system notification settings.
2) Add a Settings button/link:
   “Open Android Notification Settings (Custom)”
   - Android only.
   - It must open system settings for app notifications. If possible, deep-link to the Custom channel (alerts_custom_v2). If channel deep-link is not possible, open general app notification settings.
3) After the user sets a sound in Android settings for the Custom channel, notifications scheduled with Custom must use that sound.

E) Deliverables (required)
1) Asset cleanup + replace with my uploaded audio files (web + android raw).
2) Correct channel creation + versioned channels (_v2) and scheduling uses the _v2 mapping so sounds actually change on existing installs.
3) Singleton preview fix.
4) Working Android settings opening for Custom.
5) Provide a concise report:
   - List of files deleted/added/changed
   - Exact Android test steps:
     - Change sound in app -> schedule -> confirm sound changes immediately and no delay
     - Custom -> open settings -> set sound -> schedule -> confirm it uses the system-selected sound
     - Rapid preview switching -> confirm no overlap
