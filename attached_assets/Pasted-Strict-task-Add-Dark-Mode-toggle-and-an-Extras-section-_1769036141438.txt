Strict task: Add Dark Mode toggle and an Extras section button to the Settings page.

Scope:
- Modify ONLY the Settings page UI and related state logic.
- Do NOT change layout, routing, existing content, or visual identity.
- Do NOT remove or rename any existing settings items.
- Additions must be clean, minimal, and professional.

Goals:
1) Allow the user to manually toggle Dark Mode on/off.
2) Provide a clearly labeled “Extras” button for future optional features.
3) Keep behavior consistent across the entire app (Home, Calendar, Settings).

Implementation details:

1) Dark Mode Toggle
- Add a toggle switch (or segmented control) labeled:
  "Dark Mode"
- Place it at the top of the Settings page, above "My Alerts".
- The toggle must:
  - Reflect the current theme state (on = dark, off = light).
  - Persist user preference using localStorage.
  - Immediately apply theme changes without reload.
- Dark mode behavior:
  - Add/remove a `dark` class on the root element (e.g. <body> or #app).
  - Use existing dark/light styles where present.
  - Do NOT alter colors, spacing, or typography beyond theme switching.

2) Extras Button
- Add a button labeled:
  "Extras"
- Place it under the Dark Mode toggle.
- Style:
  - Neutral secondary button (not primary CTA).
  - Same visual language as existing Settings buttons.
- Behavior:
  - For now, clicking the button opens a placeholder view or modal
    with text:
    "More features will be available here in the future."
  - No backend logic required.
  - No feature activation yet.

3) Technical Constraints
- Use existing state management approach (React state / context if present).
- No new dependencies.
- No routing changes.
- No breaking changes to Settings structure.

4) Validation
- Dark mode toggle works from Settings and affects all screens.
- Theme choice persists after refresh.
- Extras button is visible, clickable, and non-breaking.
- Settings page remains clean and professional.

Deliverables:
- Code changes only.
- No comments, explanations, or documentation output.
- Ensure build passes and UI remains stable.

End of task.
