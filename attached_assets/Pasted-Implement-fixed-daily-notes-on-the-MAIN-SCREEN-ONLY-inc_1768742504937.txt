Implement fixed daily notes on the MAIN SCREEN ONLY, including full detailed bullet points.

Design & behavior:
- Add a small button/icon on the left side of the MAIN screen labeled "Notes" (or an icon).
- When pressed, show a collapsible section directly below the button.
- Do NOT use a modal.
- Do NOT navigate to another screen.

Visibility rules:
- Daily notes must appear ONLY on the main screen.
- Do NOT display daily notes inside the Calendar view.
- Do NOT reference daily notes from the Calendar in any way.

Content rules:
- Display static educational notes based on the current UTC weekday.
- The notes must include ALL bullet points exactly as defined below.
- Notes are read-only and not editable.

Daily notes content (must be implemented exactly):

Monday — Preparation Day
- Low liquidity and the market is often in a range.
- Focus on preparation rather than profit.
- Determine the week's High / Low.
- Draw supports and resistances.
- Read the general market trend.
- Avoid swing trades.
- Light scalping only when necessary.

Tuesday — Expansion Day
- Liquidity starts to rise.
- Often the real movement of the week begins.
- Pay attention to inflation news (CPI) when present.
- Entering with the breakout is more appropriate than oscillation.
- Avoid entering before important news.

Wednesday — Trend Day
- Highest liquidity during the week.
- The trend often continues.
- The best day for overall performance.
- Reinforce winning trades only.
- Avoid trading against the trend.
- Pay attention to interest rate decisions if present.

Thursday — Retracement Day
- Medium liquidity.
- Corrections and profit taking occur.
- Opportunities are with the main trend.
- Possible short reversals from strong levels.
- Avoid overtrading.

Friday — Liquidity Day
- Liquidity is irregular.
- Spread of false breakouts.
- Liquidity grabs and stop-hunts.
- Fast scalping only.
- Early exit is better.
- Avoid trading at the end of the day.

Saturday — Market Closed
- Market closed.

Sunday — Market Closed
- Market closed with anticipation of the start of the Asia session.

Logic rules:
- Weekday detection must use UTC time only.
- Notes update automatically when the UTC day changes.

Constraints:
- Do NOT add user notes.
- Do NOT add notifications.
- Do NOT modify the Calendar screen.
- Do NOT change alarm or session logic.
- Keep UI minimal and consistent with existing design.

Goal:
Provide full daily trading context with detailed notes, accessible from the main screen only.
