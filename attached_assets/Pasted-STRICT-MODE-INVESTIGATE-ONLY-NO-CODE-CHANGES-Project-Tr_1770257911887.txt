STRICT MODE — INVESTIGATE ONLY (NO CODE CHANGES)

Project: Trader Time Organizer (Capacitor + React/Vite + Android native plugins)

Goal:
Produce a STRICT, EVIDENCE-BASED AUDIT of the current project to identify:
1) Any crash risks (Android/iOS/PWA)
2) Any build/release risks (Play Store / Android 13+ permissions / exact alarms / foreground services)
3) Any regression risks from recent commits (especially dialogs/keyboard/notifications/alarms)
4) Any TypeScript/runtime errors that could appear only on native builds

HARD RULES:
- DO NOT modify, format, refactor, or “fix” anything.
- DO NOT run npm install / upgrade packages.
- Output must be an INVESTIGATION REPORT ONLY.

MANDATORY CHECKS (must include evidence):
A) TypeScript / build checks
- Run TypeScript typecheck (or equivalent) and report errors/warnings with exact file paths + line numbers.
- Report any Vite build warnings.

B) Android native checks
- Scan android/ for common crash sources: SecurityException, ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException, Notification channel issues, missing resources.
- Verify POST_NOTIFICATIONS request flow for Android 13+ exists and is safe.
- Verify exact alarm scheduling is protected with canScheduleExactAlarms + try/catch everywhere.
- Verify BootReceiver/FixedSessionBootReceiver cannot crash on boot.

C) UI/Runtime checks
- Confirm Dialog keyboard behavior changes are limited to dialog.tsx and do not break PWA/iOS.
- Confirm any platform guards (Capacitor.getPlatform()) are correct and consistent.

D) Data/storage checks
- Identify any storage migrations or schema assumptions that could break users after update.

DELIVERABLES:
1) “RED FLAGS” (crash/release blockers) — list with file path + line numbers + why.
2) “WARNINGS” (non-blocking risks) — list similarly.
3) “NO ISSUE” areas confirmed safe (brief).
4) A “CHANGE REPORT” section that explicitly states: NO FILES CHANGED.

If you cannot prove something from code/tests, label it “UNCONFIRMED” and state what evidence is missing (e.g., logcat needed).
