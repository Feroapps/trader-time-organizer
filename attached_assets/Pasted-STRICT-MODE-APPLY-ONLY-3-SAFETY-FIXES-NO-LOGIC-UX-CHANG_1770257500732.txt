STRICT MODE — APPLY ONLY 3 SAFETY FIXES (NO LOGIC / UX CHANGE)

Project: Trader Time Organizer (Capacitor Android + React/Vite)
Goal: Fix confirmed crash risks ONLY, with minimal diffs, without changing alarms logic, scheduling, notifications timing, UI/UX, sounds, icons, or ads.

HARD RULES:
- Change ONLY the files explicitly listed below.
- No refactors, no formatting sweeps, no dependency changes, no npm install, no AndroidManifest edits.
- Do NOT touch anything related to ads/AdMob/consent (out of scope).
- After changes, provide STRICT CHANGE REPORT with exact diffs and line numbers.
- Confirm: alarms scheduling/timing unchanged, resources unchanged, notification channels unchanged.

FIX 1 — AlarmActivity: register finishReceiver properly
File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmActivity.java
Problem: finishReceiver is declared but NEVER registered, so ACTION_FINISH_ALARM_ACTIVITY is never received.
Required change (minimal):
- In onCreate(): registerReceiver(finishReceiver, new IntentFilter(AlarmSoundService.ACTION_FINISH_ALARM_ACTIVITY))
- In onDestroy(): unregisterReceiver(finishReceiver) inside try/catch to avoid IllegalArgumentException
Constraints:
- Do not change existing alarm UI, layout, or any other logic.
- Only add what’s needed for register/unregister.

FIX 2 — AlarmActivity: crash-guard startForegroundService in volume-key STOP path
File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmActivity.java
Problem: startForegroundService(stopIntent) at dispatchKeyEvent line ~84 has no try/catch; can crash on Android 12+.
Required change (minimal):
- Wrap ONLY the startForegroundService(stopIntent) call in try/catch(Throwable)
- In catch: Log.e(TAG, "...", t) then fallback to startService(stopIntent) if possible (or just swallow safely)
Constraints:
- Must not change STOP semantics (still sends ACTION_STOP).
- Must not add new notifications or fallback UI.

FIX 3 — TypeScript: prevent runtime crash if dateUTC is missing
Files:
- client/src/screens/Calendar.tsx (lines ~142 and ~166)
- client/src/screens/DayView.tsx (line ~233)
Problem: dateUTC is optional in type, but code calls .split() and uses dates.add(dateUTC) without guard.
Required change (minimal, no behavior change for valid data):
- Add a simple guard: if (!alarm.dateUTC) return/continue for that item.
- Keep the existing filter (!a.isFixed) intact; just harden against corrupted/undefined dateUTC.
Constraints:
- Do NOT change data model, do NOT change storage format, do NOT change scheduling logic.

DELIVERABLES (MANDATORY):
A) List of files changed (must be exactly 3 files: AlarmActivity.java, Calendar.tsx, DayView.tsx)
B) Exact before/after diffs for each file (only the minimal lines changed)
C) Explicit confirmation:
   - No other files changed
   - No dependencies changed
   - No manifest changes
   - No notification scheduling/timing logic changed
   - No UI/UX changes
   - No resource/icon/sound changes
