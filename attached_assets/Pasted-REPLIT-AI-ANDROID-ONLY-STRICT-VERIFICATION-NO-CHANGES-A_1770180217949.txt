REPLIT AI — ANDROID-ONLY STRICT VERIFICATION (NO CHANGES ALLOWED)

RULES (MANDATORY):
1) DO NOT modify, create, delete, or format ANY file.
2) DO NOT run refactors, lint fixes, or “auto-fix”.
3) DO NOT change AndroidManifest.xml or Gradle files.
4) OUTPUT MUST BE A VERIFICATION REPORT ONLY (with exact file paths + exact line numbers + exact code excerpts).

GOAL:
Verify (with evidence) whether the current Android codebase is safe against the known crash/delay risks and whether the “fullScreen” alarm UX still works after removing startActivity from AlarmReceiver.

SCOPE:
Android native code + the exact TypeScript entry points that call Android scheduling/notification code.
NO iOS, NO PWA analysis unless it affects Android behavior.

TASKS — YOU MUST CHECK THESE FILES AND CONFIRM WITH EVIDENCE:

A) FIXED SESSION EXACT ALARM SAFETY
1) File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/FixedSessionBootReceiver.java
   - Confirm: it checks canScheduleExactAlarms() BEFORE calling FixedSessionScheduler.scheduleAllEnabledFixedSessions(...)
   - Provide: the exact method + lines showing the check and the call.

2) File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/FixedSessionScheduler.java
   - Confirm: scheduleNextForOneSession() (and any exact scheduling calls) are protected against SecurityException
     (either by canScheduleExactAlarms() guard OR try/catch around setExactAndAllowWhileIdle/setExact).
   - Provide: exact lines + code excerpt showing the guard/try-catch.

B) USER ALARM FULLSCREEN BEHAVIOR (CRITICAL)
3) File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmReceiver.java
   - Confirm: startActivity() is removed (if changed) and what happens instead.
   - Provide: exact lines.

4) File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmSoundService.java
   - Find: the method building the foreground notification (often buildForegroundNotification or similar).
   - Confirm ALL of the following with exact code lines:
     i) Uses NotificationCompat.CATEGORY_ALARM (or equivalent alarm category)
     ii) Uses PRIORITY_MAX / IMPORTANCE_HIGH (or equivalent)
     iii) Uses setFullScreenIntent(pendingIntentToAlarmActivity, true)
     iv) PendingIntent points to AlarmActivity (or the exact alarm UI Activity)
     v) Notification channel used is IMPORTANCE_HIGH (if channel-based)
   - If ANY of these are missing, mark it as “FAIL” and explain impact (no code changes).

C) FOREGROUND SERVICE STARTFOREGROUND RULE
5) File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmSoundService.java
   - Confirm: startForeground() is called exactly ONCE per service start (no duplicates).
   - Provide: exact lines where startForeground() is invoked.

D) POST_NOTIFICATIONS RUNTIME PERMISSION
6) File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/MainActivity.java
   - Confirm: there is a runtime permission request for POST_NOTIFICATIONS on Android 13+ (SDK 33+).
   - Provide: exact lines.
   - Confirm: it does NOT crash if denied; it continues app flow.
   - If it relies on activity result callbacks, show where handled.

E) EXACT ALARM PERMISSION UX + SETTINGS BUTTON
7) TypeScript: client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts
   - Confirm: openExactAlarmSettings() uses Android intent and is guarded by isAndroidNative().
   - Provide: exact lines.
8) TypeScript: client/src/screens/Settings.tsx
   - Confirm: Android-only buttons are hidden behind isAndroidPlatform() (not shown on iOS/PWA).
   - Provide: exact lines.

F) DUPLICATE NOTIFICATION RISK
9) TypeScript: client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts
   - Confirm: fixed sessions are skipped on Android in TS to avoid double scheduling (alarm.isFixed && isAndroidNative()) return;
   - Provide: exact lines.
10) Android:
   - Confirm: FixedSessionScheduler and MainActivity/BootReceiver do not schedule duplicates that would cause double notifications.
   - Provide: reasoning backed by code (requestCode uniqueness + FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT overwrite).

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):
1) “PASS/FAIL” per item (A1..F10)
2) For each item: 
   - File path
   - Line numbers
   - Code excerpt (5–20 lines)
3) Final “Crash Risk Verdict (Android)” with 3 levels only: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
4) NO recommendations that require code changes unless you label them clearly as “Suggestion (not applied)”.

REMEMBER: NO FILE MODIFICATIONS. REPORT ONLY.
