REPLIT AI — STRICT ANDROID INVESTIGATION ONLY (NO CHANGES)

Problem (Android ONLY):
- Soft keyboard does NOT appear in Capacitor Android build.
- Cannot type in NoteModal textarea.
- Cannot edit AlertModal label input.
- PWA works.
- This WORKED in a previous Android build.
- No phone settings changes.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
1) DO NOT modify ANY file.
2) DO NOT install dependencies (@capacitor/keyboard or anything).
3) DO NOT run sync/build.
4) ONLY produce an investigation report with concrete evidence from THIS repo.

MANDATORY: DIFF-DRIVEN CHECK (this is required)
A) Identify what changed between the last working Android build and the current one:
- List recent commits or changed files affecting Android runtime/keyboard/insets.
- If you cannot access history, then compare current Android-related files and highlight high-risk configs.

MANDATORY: COLLECT EVIDENCE FROM THESE FILES (quote exact lines)
1) android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- MainActivity attributes: theme, launchMode, configChanges, windowSoftInputMode, exported, etc.
2) android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml and values-night/styles.xml (or themes.xml)
- Any window flags: windowIsTranslucent, windowFullscreen, fitsSystemWindows, decorFitsSystemWindows, etc.
3) android/app/src/main/java/**/MainActivity.java
- Any edge-to-edge flags, WindowInsetsController, setDecorFitsSystemWindows, status/nav bar changes.
4) capacitor.config.ts (and generated android/app/src/main/assets/capacitor.config.json if exists)
- splashImmersive/splashFullScreen, StatusBar/NavigationBar settings, any keyboard settings if present.
5) client/src/utils/capacitorInit.ts
- Any StatusBar/NavigationBar calls that could impact insets/keyboard.
6) Verify Android runtime environment assumptions:
- Show how you know the device is Android 15+ or WebView version issue (DO NOT assume).

MANDATORY: PROVE WHICH OF THESE IS TRUE (choose 1 with evidence, not guesses)
- (X) Focus is lost immediately on input tap (show how to log focus events or code where focus is stolen).
- (Y) WebView does not resize / insets broken (edge-to-edge / immersive flags) causing IME not to attach.
- (Z) Overlay blocks pointer/focus (Dialog overlay / CSS pointer-events) specifically on Android WebView.
- (W) Activity/theme configuration prevents IME (translucent/immersive/adjustPan vs adjustResize).
- (V) A plugin initialization or crash prevents keyboard (logcat evidence required).

DELIVERABLE:
- A strict report with:
  1) “What changed since last working Android build” (file list)
  2) “Evidence excerpts” (file path + exact lines)
  3) “Most likely root cause” (ONE statement, tied directly to the excerpts)
  4) “Next single diagnostic step” that I can do on device WITHOUT code changes
     (e.g., one adb logcat command and what to look for)

If you cannot prove the root cause with repo evidence, say: “INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE” and specify exactly what logcat output you need.
