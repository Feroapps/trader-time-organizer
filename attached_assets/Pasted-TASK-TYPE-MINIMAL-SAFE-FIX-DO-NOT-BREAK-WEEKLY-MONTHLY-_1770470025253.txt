TASK TYPE: MINIMAL SAFE FIX (DO NOT BREAK WEEKLY/MONTHLY REPEATS)

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:
- Change ONLY Android native code related to stopping the CURRENTLY RINGING user alarm.
- DO NOT disable alarms.
- DO NOT delete alarms from SharedPreferences.
- DO NOT change repeat logic (weekly/monthly) or next-occurrence calculations.
- DO NOT modify capacitorInit.ts, nativeNotifications.ts, or any JS/TS scheduling logic.
- DO NOT add logs/tests/refactors/formatting changes.

PROBLEM:
After pressing Stop, the alarm sound stops. But when the user later opens the app, the sound briefly replays.
Diagnostic indicates stopCurrentAlarm() stops the sound service but does NOT cancel the underlying AlarmManager PendingIntent created in scheduleAlarm().

GOAL:
In stopCurrentAlarm(), cancel ONLY the AlarmManager PendingIntent for the currently ringing alarm, using the EXACT same PendingIntent identity used by scheduleAlarm(). This prevents any stale PendingIntent from being re-fired, without affecting future repeats.

REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION (STRICT):
1) Locate UserAlarmPlugin.java:
   - Method: scheduleAlarm(...) (reported around lines 79–84) where the AlarmManager PendingIntent is created.
   - Method: stopCurrentAlarm(...) (reported around lines 175–195).

2) Create/Reuse a single helper method (or reuse existing one if already present) that builds the Broadcast PendingIntent for a given alarmId EXACTLY as scheduleAlarm does:
   - Same receiver class (e.g., AlarmReceiver)
   - Same intent action
   - Same extras (if used when creating the PendingIntent)
   - Same requestCode
   - Same PendingIntent flags (UPDATE_CURRENT / IMMUTABLE, etc.)

3) In stopCurrentAlarm(...):
   - Keep the existing ACTION_STOP intent to AlarmSoundService (do not remove).
   - After stopping the service, call AlarmManager.cancel(pendingIntentForCurrentAlarmId) using the SAME pendingIntent builder from step (2).
   - DO NOT remove the alarm from SharedPreferences.
   - DO NOT change enabled state.
   - DO NOT touch any reschedule logic.

DELIVERABLE:
- Implement the above minimal change.
- Confirm in your response:
  a) The exact receiver/action/requestCode/flags used for the canceled PendingIntent match scheduleAlarm().
  b) No SharedPreferences deletion/disable was added.
  c) Weekly/monthly repeats remain unaffected because alarm data persists and rescheduling remains unchanged.
