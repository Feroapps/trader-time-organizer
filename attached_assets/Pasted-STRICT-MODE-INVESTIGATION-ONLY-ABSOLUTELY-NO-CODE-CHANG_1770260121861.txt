STRICT MODE — INVESTIGATION ONLY (ABSOLUTELY NO CODE CHANGES)

Project: Trader Time Organizer
Tech: Capacitor + React/Vite + Android native

GOAL:
Produce a FULL, evidence-based audit of the CURRENT project to find:
1) Crash risks (Android / iOS / PWA)
2) Build/release risks (Play Store compliance, Android 13+ permissions, exact alarms, foreground services)
3) Silent-failure risks (alarms/notifications that fail without crashing)
4) Regression risks from recent commits (dialogs/keyboard/notifications/alarms)
5) TypeScript/runtime errors that could appear only on native builds

HARD RULES (MANDATORY):
- DO NOT modify, format, refactor, or “fix” ANYTHING.
- DO NOT create commits.
- DO NOT run npm install / upgrade packages / change lockfiles.
- Output must be INVESTIGATION REPORT ONLY (read-only).

MANDATORY CHECKS (must include evidence):
A) TypeScript / Build
- Run: npx tsc --noEmit
- Report ALL errors/warnings with exact: file path + line numbers + TS error codes.
- Run: npm run build
- Report Vite build warnings (copy the exact warning text + where it comes from).

B) Android native (android/ folder)
- Search for crash sources:
  - startForegroundService without try/catch (ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException risk)
  - startForeground called late or multiple times
  - missing notification channels before startForeground
  - SecurityException paths around setExactAndAllowWhileIdle / exact alarms
  - any missing resources referenced (icons/layout/sounds)
- Verify POST_NOTIFICATIONS flow:
  - Manifest permission exists
  - Runtime request exists for Android 13+
  - App behavior if denied (no crash)
- Verify exact alarm flow:
  - canScheduleExactAlarms() checks + try/catch everywhere exact alarms are used
  - BootReceiver / FixedSessionBootReceiver cannot crash on boot

C) UI / Runtime (JS/TS side)
- Confirm Dialog/keyboard behavior changes are limited and platform-guarded (Android only) and do not affect PWA/iOS.
- Verify all platform guards (Capacitor.isNativePlatform + getPlatform) are consistent.
- Look for global CSS / pointer-events / overlays that could block input.

D) Data / Storage
- Identify any migrations or schema assumptions that could break existing users:
  - alarms schema fields (dateUTC, repeatDays, isFixed, isEnabled)
  - notes schema
  - any localStorage/IndexedDB migrations that could delete data or cause crashes

DELIVERABLES (STRICT FORMAT):
1) RED FLAGS (crash / release blockers) — each item MUST include:
   - file path + line numbers + why it’s a blocker
2) WARNINGS (non-blocking risks) — same evidence format
3) NO ISSUE / CONFIRMED SAFE areas — brief list
4) UNCONFIRMED items — label clearly + what evidence is missing (e.g., logcat)
5) CHANGE REPORT — MUST explicitly say:
   - Files modified: 0
   - Dependencies changed: 0
   - Config changed: 0
   - NO FILES WERE CHANGED

IMPORTANT:
If you cannot prove something from code/build output, mark it UNCONFIRMED. Do NOT guess.
