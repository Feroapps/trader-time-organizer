CRITICAL ANDROID NOTIFICATIONS FAILURE — REQUIRE ROOT CAUSE PROOF

STATUS:
- ALL Android permissions are ENABLED:
  • POST_NOTIFICATIONS = GRANTED
  • Exact alarms = ALLOWED
  • Battery = UNRESTRICTED
- App rebuilt from scratch (git clone → clean install).
- Tests performed with screen ON and OFF.
- Result: NO session notifications AND NO user alarms fire (2 min / 5 min tests).

THIS IS NOT A DEVICE OR PERMISSION ISSUE.
THIS IS A CODE / LIFECYCLE / REGISTRATION FAILURE.

YOUR TASK (MANDATORY, NO GUESSING):

1) VERIFY EXECUTION (WITH CODE PROOF)
- Show EXACT code lines proving that:
  a) rescheduleAllAlarms() IS CALLED on:
     - app cold start
     - app resume
  b) scheduleUserAlarmNative() IS ACTUALLY EXECUTED when a user alert is created
- If any call is missing, FIX IT and show the diff.

2) VERIFY ANDROID REGISTRATION (WITH FILE CONTENT)
- Output FULL content of:
  • AndroidManifest.xml
  • AlarmReceiver.java
  • AlarmSoundService.java
  • UserAlarmPlugin.java
- Prove that:
  • Receiver is registered
  • Service is registered
  • Foreground service starts correctly
  • No missing exported / permission flags

3) VERIFY TIME CALCULATION
- Prove (with logs or code) that:
  • triggerTimeMs is ALWAYS in the FUTURE
  • No UTC → Local conversion bug schedules alarms in the past

4) VERIFY NOTIFICATION CHANNELS (SESSION ALERTS)
- Show channel creation code
- Prove channel importance != NONE
- Prove sound is attached and not muted by code

5) ADD TEMPORARY HARD LOGGING (REQUIRED)
Add logs in:
- rescheduleAllAlarms()
- scheduleAlarmNotification()
- scheduleUserAlarmNative()
- AlarmReceiver.onReceive()
- AlarmSoundService.onStartCommand()

Logs MUST clearly show:
- Function entered
- Alarm ID
- Trigger time (ms)
- Current time (ms)

OUTPUT RULES:
- NO assumptions
- NO explanations without code
- SHOW exact files and lines
- If something is missing, FIX IT and show FULL updated file content

GOAL:
At least ONE alarm or notification MUST fire within 2 minutes.
If not, the execution path is broken and must be proven.
