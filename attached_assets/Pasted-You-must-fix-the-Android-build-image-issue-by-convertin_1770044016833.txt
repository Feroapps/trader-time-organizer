You must fix the Android build image issue by converting ALL notification/icon images to REAL PNG files.

Context:
- The project currently contains images that are JPEG-encoded but saved with .png extension (Android Studio shows "JPEG" for files like ic_stat_notification1.png).
- This breaks AAPT2 compilation when generating a signed AAB.

Goal:
- Convert every affected image under android/app/src/main/res/** (drawable*, mipmap*, etc.) to true PNG encoding.
- Keep file names the same when they are referenced by Android resources (e.g., ic_stat_notification1.png must remain that name if referenced).
- Remove any .jpg/.jpeg originals after conversion (do not keep duplicates).
- Ensure the Android build succeeds (AAPT2 resource compilation).

Strict requirements:
1) Scan these folders recursively:
   - android/app/src/main/res/drawable*
   - android/app/src/main/res/mipmap*
   - android/app/src/main/res/raw (if any images exist)
2) For every file with extension .png, verify its actual format by inspecting its header/magic bytes.
   - If it is JPEG content, convert it to a real PNG (lossless).
   - Overwrite the same .png path with the converted PNG output.
3) For any .jpg/.jpeg files found in those res folders:
   - Convert them to .png with the same base name.
   - Update ALL references in Android resources if needed:
     - XML under res/** (layouts, drawables, etc.)
     - AndroidManifest.xml if any icon references exist
   - Then delete the old .jpg/.jpeg files.
4) Do NOT remove or rename resources unless you also update every reference.
5) After conversions, run a cleanup step:
   - Remove any duplicate icon/notification assets that only existed as JPEG copies.
6) Provide a short report:
   - List every file changed (before format -> after format)
   - List every file deleted
   - Confirm there are no JPEG-encoded files left in android/app/src/main/res/**
7) Finally, ensure Gradle can compile resources successfully (no AAPT2 errors).

Use the safest approach available in this environment (Node + a converter library, or a script executed by the agent). Do not ask me questions—just implement.
