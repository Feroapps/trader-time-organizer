STRICT TASK — APPLY MODIFICATION (B) NOW + PREPARE STEP 2 (SUGGESTION ONLY)

Context:
We already applied (A): try/catch around ContextCompat.startForegroundService() in:
android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmReceiver.java

Now apply (B) as an improvement that DOES NOT change scheduling logic or times:
Goal of (B):
If Android refuses to start the foreground service from the BroadcastReceiver (Android 12+ restrictions), the app must NOT crash and must still show a clear alarm notification (fallback) so the user is alerted.

RULES (MANDATORY):
1) CHANGE ONLY ONE FILE:
   - android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmReceiver.java
2) Do NOT modify ANY other files (no Manifest, no MainActivity, no services, no TS/React, no dependencies).
3) Do NOT change any alarm timing/scheduling or IDs.
4) Fallback behavior MUST happen ONLY inside the catch block (only when startForegroundService fails).
5) Keep existing logs. Add clear logs for fallback path.

IMPLEMENTATION (B) — EXACT REQUIREMENTS:
- In AlarmReceiver.onReceive():
  - Keep the current try/catch around startForegroundService.
  - In the catch block:
    1) Create/ensure a notification channel ONLY if needed (Android O+). Use a NEW channel ID local to AlarmReceiver, e.g. "alarm_fallback", importance HIGH.
    2) Post a high-priority notification that:
       - Title: "Alarm"
       - Text: use label if present, otherwise "Alarm"
       - Category: CATEGORY_ALARM
       - Priority: PRIORITY_MAX
       - AutoCancel: true
       - Uses the existing app small icon (use the same small icon resource already used in the project; if unsure, use android.R.drawable.ic_lock_idle_alarm as a safe fallback).
       - On tap: opens AlarmActivity (fullScreenIntent is optional; do NOT startActivity directly).
       - Include extras (alarmId/label/soundId) into the intent to AlarmActivity.
    3) DO NOT attempt to start any service in fallback (no startService / startForegroundService). Fallback = notification only.
- Keep normal path unchanged when startForegroundService succeeds.

DELIVERABLES:
A) STRICT CHANGE REPORT
   - List files changed (must be exactly 1)
   - Provide exact BEFORE/AFTER diff (only the changed lines/blocks)
B) CONFIRMATIONS (explicit):
   - No other files changed ✅
   - No scheduling/timing logic changed ✅
   - Android-only change ✅
C) STEP 2 (SUGGESTION ONLY — DO NOT APPLY):
   Propose a separate optional hardening step to improve reliability further, but do NOT implement it unless I later say "APPLY STEP 2".
   Step 2 should be one of:
   - show a UI hint inside the app when notifications/foreground service fails, OR
   - log/report a one-time flag in SharedPreferences for diagnostics
   Keep it minimal and clearly marked as NOT APPLIED.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT ask me questions. Implement (B) exactly, then output the change report + Step 2 suggestion only.
