Please diagnose and fix the alarm audio playback issue automatically using the uploaded MP3 file. 
I do NOT want any manual steps from me. Execute the following steps strictly in order and print a clear report to the browser Console.

1) Audio file selection:
- If a file named "alarm.mp3" exists, use it.
- Otherwise, locate and use the most recently uploaded valid MP3 audio file in the project.

2) File placement and serving:
- Ensure a folder named "public" exists at the project root. If it does not exist, create it.
- Copy or move the selected audio file to: public/alarm.mp3 (overwrite any existing file).
- Remove any duplicate copies of alarm.mp3 from other locations (e.g., client/public) to avoid conflicts.

3) Verify static serving:
- Verify that the file is accessible at: https://<your-repl>.replit.app/alarm.mp3
- Perform a fetch request to this URL and log to the Console:
  - HTTP status code
  - Content-Type
  - Content-Length
- Log the direct URL clearly to the Console.

4) Update application code:
- Update all audio references in the codebase to use "/alarm.mp3" as the audio source.
- Ensure any soundPlayer or playAlarm utility uses "/alarm.mp3" exclusively.

5) Browser audio unlock (testing only):
- Add a temporary button on the Home screen labeled "Enable Alarm Sound".
- On button click, execute directly inside the click handler:
  let a = new Audio('/alarm.mp3');
  await a.play().catch(err => console.error(err));
  a.pause();
  a.currentTime = 0;
- Hide the button after the first successful click.
- Log either "AUDIO UNLOCKED" or the full error message to the Console.

6) Playback test:
- After unlocking audio, run this test automatically and log the result:
  new Audio('/alarm.mp3').play()
- Log "PLAYBACK SUCCESS" or "PLAYBACK FAILED" with the full error object.

7) Publish verification:
- If playback succeeds, publish/republish the app.
- After publish, repeat the playback test in the published environment.
- Log to Console: "ALARM AUDIO READY AT /alarm.mp3" with the full published URL.

8) Fallback strategy (if audio still fails):
- If the audio file cannot be reliably served or played due to Replit environment limitations, automatically apply ONE of the following fallbacks (in this order):
  A) Convert the MP3 to Base64 and embed it as a data URI inside the soundPlayer (temporary workaround).
  B) Serve the audio via a simple static endpoint if available in this environment.
- After applying a fallback, re-run the playback test and log the result.

9) Constraints:
- Do NOT change alarm scheduling logic.
- Do NOT change notification logic.
- Do NOT add ads or unrelated UI.
- Only fix audio file serving, audio references, testing, and verification.

10) Final report:
- Print a concise final report to the Console including:
  - Was public/alarm.mp3 created? (yes/no)
  - Direct audio URL and HTTP status
  - Result of Audio.play() test (success/failure + error message)
  - Whether a fallback was applied (Base64 / endpoint / none)
  - Commit/Publish note used

Suggested commit / publish note:
"Fix alarm audio playback: serve alarm.mp3 from /public and verify published audio."
