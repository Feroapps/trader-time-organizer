REPLIT AI — STRICT MODE. DO NOT CHANGE OR EDIT ANY FILES. NO COMMITS. NO INSTALLS. NO SYNC/BUILD.
You are ONLY allowed to READ and ANALYZE the current repo state and respond with a report.

TASK A — Dark Mode Status (post-fix verification)
1) Verify the dark-mode persistence implementation is correct and complete:
   - Confirm the inline <script> in client/index.html runs BEFORE React render and correctly applies/removes the "dark" class.
   - Confirm App.tsx saves localStorage key "theme" with values "dark"/"light" when toggling.
   - Check for any other code that may overwrite theme on startup (e.g., capacitorInit.ts, App.tsx effects, Tailwind config, CSS).
2) List any remaining edge cases or regressions:
   - Flash of wrong theme (FOUC) risk
   - SSR/Prerender issues (if any)
   - iOS WKWebView / Android WebView localStorage availability edge cases
3) Output the exact file paths + line ranges you reviewed, and your PASS/FAIL verdict for theme persistence.

TASK B — Android Release Readiness (NO CHANGES)
1) Provide a go/no-go assessment for releasing the Android build to Play Console (internal/closed/production).
2) Identify ONLY the top 10 highest-risk items that could cause:
   - crash on launch
   - alarms/notifications not firing
   - ANR/background restrictions
   - AdMob/rewarded ad failures
   - permission-related failures (POST_NOTIFICATIONS, SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM, FOREGROUND_SERVICE)
3) For each risk item:
   - severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - likelihood on real devices
   - exact file(s) and line range(s) involved
   - recommended mitigation (DESCRIPTION ONLY — do not apply)

ABSOLUTE OUTPUT FORMAT (strict):
- Section A: Dark Mode Verification
  - Verdict: PASS/FAIL
  - Evidence: bullets with file:line references
  - Remaining Risks: bullets
- Section B: Android Release Readiness
  - Verdict: GO / GO WITH WARNINGS / NO-GO
  - Top Risks (1..10): each with severity, likelihood, file:line, mitigation (description only)

REMINDER:
DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING. DO NOT SUGGEST CHANGES OUTSIDE THE FORMAT. DO NOT RUN COMMANDS.
