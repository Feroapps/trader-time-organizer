TASK TYPE: PRECISE CODE EXTRACTION FOR A GUARANTEED FIX (NO CHANGES YET)

STRICT RULES:
- DO NOT modify any code.
- DO NOT add logs, tests, or debug prints.
- DO NOT refactor, rename, or reformat.
- OUTPUT ONLY the requested code sections, exactly as-is (copy/paste).
- No explanations, no summaries—CODE ONLY.

GOAL:
We want a 100% guaranteed fix. To do that we must cancel the EXACT SAME AlarmManager PendingIntent that was created in scheduleAlarm(). This requires seeing the exact PendingIntent identity:
- Receiver class
- Intent action (if any)
- Intent extras (if any used when creating the PendingIntent)
- requestCode
- PendingIntent flags

REQUESTED CODE SECTIONS (PASTE EXACTLY):

A) UserAlarmPlugin.java
1) The FULL scheduleAlarm(...) method (entire method).
2) The EXACT block where it builds the Broadcast PendingIntent for AlarmManager:
   - the Intent construction (component, setAction, putExtra calls)
   - requestCode value
   - PendingIntent.getBroadcast(...) line with flags
3) The EXACT block where it calls AlarmManager.setExact / setExactAndAllowWhileIdle / setAlarmClock (the scheduling call).
4) The FULL cancelAlarm(...) method (entire method).
5) The FULL stopCurrentAlarm(...) method (entire method).

B) AlarmReceiver.java
1) The FULL onReceive(...) method (entire method).
2) Any constants used for intent actions/extras (ACTION_..., EXTRA_...).

C) AlarmSoundService.java
1) The FULL onStartCommand(...) method (entire method).
2) The FULL stopAlarm(...) method (entire method).
3) The constants used for actions/extras (ACTION_STOP, EXTRA_ALARM_ID, etc.).

D) Any shared constants file (if exists)
If actions/extras are defined in a Constants class/file, paste that section too.

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide each file section in its own code block.
- Include file path at the top of each block as a comment.
- No ellipses (...) — full methods only.

STOP CONDITION:
If any of these methods do not exist, explicitly say “METHOD NOT FOUND” and paste the closest equivalent method where the PendingIntent is created/canceled.
