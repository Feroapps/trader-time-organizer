STRICT REPLIT AGENT PROMPT

Project: Trader Time Organizer

Problem:
In dark mode, the current time indicator (the vertical line with the small downward triangle ▼) becomes hard to see, especially on the UTC timeline. The indicator visually blends with light or similar session colors (notably around 22:00–00:00), making it almost invisible. This issue is more noticeable in UTC than in Local Time, causing inconsistent behavior between the two timelines.

Goal:
Make the current time indicator clearly visible and consistent in BOTH Local Time and UTC timelines when dark mode is enabled.

Required Changes (Dark Mode Only):
1. Unify the appearance and behavior of the current time indicator between Local Time and UTC.
2. The indicator line must remain clearly visible on top of ALL timeline colors.
3. Apply the SAME styling logic to both timelines.

Implementation Rules:
- Keep layout, spacing, routing, logic, and data unchanged.
- Do NOT change session colors.
- Do NOT add animations.
- Do NOT modify light mode behavior.
- Only adjust visual styling of the current time indicator in dark mode.

Visual Specification (Dark Mode):
- Indicator line color: pure white (#FFFFFF)
- Line width: 2px
- Add a subtle background overlay behind the line:
  - Overlay width: 4px
  - Overlay color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)
  - Overlay must be centered behind the indicator line
- Triangle marker (▼):
  - Same white color (#FFFFFF)
  - Must stay aligned with the indicator line
  - No size or shape change

Behavior:
- The indicator must visually sit ABOVE all timeline session colors.
- The indicator must remain readable regardless of background brightness.
- Local Time and UTC indicators must look and behave identically.

Acceptance Criteria:
- In dark mode, the current time indicator is immediately visible on both Local and UTC timelines.
- The indicator does not disappear or fade when crossing light-colored session blocks.
- No visual regressions in light mode.
- No other UI elements are affected.

This task is COMPLETE when the current time indicator is equally clear, readable, and consistent in both timelines under dark mode.
