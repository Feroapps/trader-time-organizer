FIX ANDROID ALERTS: SESSION (FIXED) + USER ALARMS MUST FIRE WITH APP OPEN OR CLOSED

PROBLEM (REPRODUCIBLE):
1) Session Alerts (built-in / isFixed=true): notification + sound + message do NOT fire reliably when the app is OPEN or CLOSED.
2) User-created alerts (custom): do NOT fire when the app is CLOSED on Android. (They may work only when app is open.)

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT change package name or file paths.
- Do NOT add new features/UI.
- Only fix scheduling + delivery so alerts fire with app open OR closed.
- Keep local notifications (no web push).
- Output FULL final content of every file you modify, and list exactly what you changed.

WHAT “WORKING” MEANS:
- On Android, both Session Alerts and User Alerts must trigger at the correct time even if:
  a) the app is in background, or
  b) the app is swiped away / killed, or
  c) the phone is locked.
- When fired:
  - show notification (title/body)
  - play the selected sound
  - if user alert uses native AlarmManager plugin, it must still produce a visible notification + sound.

REQUIRED INVESTIGATION (DO THIS BY CODE INSPECTION + FIX):
1) Verify rescheduleAllAlarms() schedules ALL enabled alarms, including isFixed=true (Session Alerts). If not, fix.
2) Verify initialization: rescheduleAllAlarms() is called on native app start AND on resume. If not, fix (minimal).
3) Verify BootReceiver:
   - Confirm it is registered in AndroidManifest.xml with BOOT_COMPLETED.
   - Ensure it reschedules alarms after reboot (calls into scheduling logic or recreates AlarmManager alarms).
4) Verify AlarmManager path for user alerts:
   - AlarmReceiver must show a notification + start sound service when triggered.
   - Ensure PendingIntent flags + requestCode are stable and unique per alarmId.
   - Ensure exact alarm permission handling does not prevent scheduling (Android 12+).
5) Verify notification channels and sound mapping:
   - Ensure channelId exists before schedule.
   - Ensure sound resource names match actual files in android res/raw (or correct mapping).
6) Add minimal logging in native (Java) and TS to confirm scheduling + firing (do not spam).

DELIVERABLES:
- Provide step-by-step fix with ONLY necessary code changes.
- Output FULL UPDATED CONTENT of every modified file.
- Provide a minimal test checklist (3-5 steps) to verify on a real Android device.
