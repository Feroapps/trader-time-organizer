REPLIT AI — ANDROID INPUT BUG (STRICT INSTRUCTIONS)

GOAL
Fix Android (Capacitor WebView) issue where user cannot type in:
1) NoteModal textarea (Add Note)
2) AlertModal input (User alarm label / rename)

SYMPTOM
On Android native build only:
- Keyboard may appear, but typing does not enter text (inputs behave “non-editable”).
On PWA/desktop it works.

ABSOLUTE RULES
1) FIRST: Do a diagnosis summary (root cause hypothesis) BEFORE changing anything.
2) Then apply the MINIMAL fix that restores typing on Android.
3) DO NOT refactor, rename, reformat, optimize, or auto-correct unrelated code.
4) DO NOT modify Android native files (android/**) unless you prove it’s required.
5) Keep PWA behavior unchanged.
6) After changes: provide a STRICT CHANGE REPORT:
   - EXACT file paths changed
   - For each file: show BEFORE and AFTER snippets for ONLY the edited lines/blocks
   - Explain why each change is necessary (short)
7) If you cannot be 100% sure, add an OPTIONAL “Plan B” but DO NOT implement Plan B.

WHAT TO CHECK (DIAGNOSIS STEP)
- Verify whether Radix Dialog focus trap is the cause on Android WebView:
  - client/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx
  - client/src/components/AlertModal.tsx
  - client/src/components/NoteModal.tsx
- Check if DialogContent wrapper forwards props like trapFocus / disableOutsidePointerEvents.
- Confirm platform detection available via @capacitor/core.

FIX REQUIREMENT (IMPLEMENTATION STEP)
Implement ONE of these minimal fixes (choose the smallest):
Option A (preferred): Disable trapFocus ONLY on Android native:
- In the DialogContent wrapper OR in the two modals (AlertModal/NoteModal),
  set trapFocus={false} ONLY when Capacitor.isNativePlatform() && Capacitor.getPlatform()==="android".
- Keep trapFocus enabled on web/PWA and iOS.
Option B: If trapFocus prop cannot be passed due to wrapper typing,
  update dialog.tsx to forward all props correctly (without changing visuals).

LIMIT SCOPE
- Only touch files necessary to fix typing.
- If you edit dialog.tsx, ensure you do NOT change styling/className strings.

OUTPUT FORMAT
1) DIAGNOSIS (short, bullet points)
2) FIX APPLIED (what you did)
3) STRICT CHANGE REPORT (files + exact diffs for edited blocks only)
