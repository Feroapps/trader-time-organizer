YOU WILL MODIFY ONLY ONE FILE:
FILE: client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts

GOAL:
Fix alarm scheduling reliability on Android WITHOUT refactoring unrelated code.
Keep ALL existing behavior except the specific fixes below.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change file paths.
- Do NOT rename exports.
- Do NOT refactor formatting broadly.
- Do NOT touch other files.
- Do NOT add new features.
- Output the FULL FINAL CONTENT of the file after edits.

REQUIRED FIXES (ONLY THESE):

1) FIX CANCEL PATH FOR USER ALARMS (Android AlarmManager)
Current bug: when an alarm is disabled, scheduleAlarmNotification() calls cancelAlarmNotification(alarm.id) without isUserAlarm=true, so Android AlarmManager alarms may NOT be canceled.
Do this:
- In scheduleAlarmNotification(), when alarm.isEnabled is false:
  - call: await cancelAlarmNotification(alarm.id, !alarm.isFixed);
  - (Explanation: user alarms are !isFixed, session alerts are isFixed.)
- Also in scheduleAlarmNotification(), before returning early for non-native, keep existing logic.

2) MAKE “PAST TIME” GUARD SAFE FOR NEAR-FUTURE TESTS
Current code rejects triggerTimeMs <= now and returns error.
This may block alarms scheduled “within 1 minute” due to execution delay.
Do this:
- Introduce a small tolerance window constant in this file only:
  const PAST_TOLERANCE_MS = 3000;
- Replace the check with:
  if (triggerTimeMs <= now + PAST_TOLERANCE_MS) { ... }
- Keep logging, but update the log message to include tolerance and actual delta.

3) DO NOT CHANGE THE SCHEDULING ROUTING
- Keep: user alarms on Android → scheduleUserAlarmNative(...) then return.
- Keep: session alerts → LocalNotifications.schedule(...).
- Do NOT modify getNextOccurrence() logic.

4) KEEP LOGGING BUT DO NOT ADD EXCESSIVE NEW LOGS
- You may add at most 2 new log lines related to (1) cancel isUserAlarm and (2) past tolerance.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Print the FULL FINAL CONTENT of client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts only.
- No explanations, no diff, no extra text.
