ROLE: Replit Agent inside trader-time-organizer.
GOAL: (1) Move the two Android settings buttons from the Alert Sound library modal/page into Settings screen, and (2) fix them so they actually open Android settings on Capacitor Android.
SAFETY: This change MUST NOT affect alarm scheduling, weekly/monthly repeats, notifications, or any alarm logic.

NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT modify any alarm scheduling code paths (scheduleAlarm, cancelAlarm, rescheduleAllAlarms, getNextOccurrence, etc.).
- Only touch code needed for (a) button placement and (b) opening Android settings.
- Keep button labels exactly:
  1) "Open Android Alarm Sound Settings"
  2) "Open Battery Optimization Settings"

TASK A — Implement a native Android settings opener (minimal):
1) File: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/UserAlarmPlugin.java
Add ONE new @PluginMethod named openAndroidSettings that:
- reads "action" (string, required)
- reads "useAppPackage" (boolean, optional, default false)
- creates Intent intent = new Intent(action)
- if useAppPackage == true: intent.setData(Uri.fromParts("package", context.getPackageName(), null))
- intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)
- context.startActivity(intent)
- returns { success: true } or { success: false, error: "..."} without throwing
IMPORTANT: Do not modify existing methods.

TASK B — Fix JS side (stop using intent: URLs):
1) File: client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts
Replace the current implementations of:
- openAndroidAlarmSoundSettings()
- openAndroidBatteryOptimizationSettings()
so they DO NOT use window.location.href or intent:#Intent.
Instead, call the new plugin method via registerPlugin('UserAlarmPlugin') and try actions with fallbacks:

For Alarm Sound button try in this order:
1) android.settings.SOUND_SETTINGS
2) android.settings.SETTINGS
3) android.settings.APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS (useAppPackage: true)

For Battery Optimization button try in this order:
1) android.settings.IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION_SETTINGS
2) android.settings.BATTERY_SAVER_SETTINGS
3) android.settings.APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS (useAppPackage: true)
4) android.settings.SETTINGS

Implementation rules:
- Add a helper openAction(action, useAppPackage=false) that returns boolean success.
- If not Android native, do nothing (or log warn).
- No other functions changed.

TASK C — Move buttons into Settings screen UI:
1) File: client/src/screens/Settings.tsx
Ensure BOTH buttons are rendered in Settings screen (not only inside the sound library UI).
Place them under the "Alert Sound" section (below the Alert Sound card/list item is fine).
Use the same onClick handlers that call:
- openAndroidAlarmSoundSettings()
- openAndroidBatteryOptimizationSettings()
Remove/disable them from the sound library UI if they currently exist there so they appear ONLY in Settings screen.

DELIVERABLE:
- Provide the exact final code blocks you changed in each file (UserAlarmPlugin.java, nativeNotifications.ts, Settings.tsx).
- Confirm no other files were modified.
- Mention the exact new method signature and where it is used.
