STRICT FINAL RELEASE READINESS CHECK — NO CODE CHANGES ALLOWED

You are acting as a senior Android release engineer performing a final pre-production audit.

Scope
	•	Platform: Android (Google Play)
	•	Current state: Post-fix, post-verification
	•	Goal: Decision only — NO implementation

Rules (MANDATORY)
	1.	❌ DO NOT modify any file
	2.	❌ DO NOT suggest code snippets
	3.	❌ DO NOT refactor, optimize, or rewrite
	4.	❌ DO NOT apply fixes
	5.	❌ DO NOT touch Android, iOS, PWA, or client code
	6.	✅ Analysis + judgment only

Tasks

1️⃣ Release Readiness Decision
Answer clearly and explicitly:
	•	Is the application READY for Google Play production release?
Answer must be one of:
	•	YES — ready for production
	•	YES — ready with known limitations
	•	NO — blocking issues remain

If NO, list blocking issues only (crash, ANR, policy violation).

⸻

2️⃣ Crash & Stability Assessment
Based on the current verified state, confirm:
	•	Any remaining crash paths?
	•	Any SecurityException / ForegroundService / AlarmManager risks?
	•	Any Android 13+ permission-related fatal issues?
	•	Any OEM-specific issues that can cause app termination?

Only list real risks, not theoretical ones.

⸻

3️⃣ Google Play Policy Compliance
Confirm whether the app:
	•	Complies with POST_NOTIFICATIONS
	•	Complies with SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM policy usage
	•	Uses foregroundServiceType appropriately
	•	Has no deceptive permission flows
	•	Is acceptable under Play Store review standards

Answer: PASS / PASS WITH NOTES / FAIL

⸻

4️⃣ Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)
List only:
	•	Limitations that do NOT prevent release
	•	Items that can be documented as:
“Behavior may vary by device / Android version”

Do NOT propose fixes — description only.

⸻

5️⃣ Final Verdict Summary
End your response with this exact format:

FINAL VERDICT
	•	Release decision: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌
	•	Crash risk: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
	•	Play Store rejection risk: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
	•	Recommendation:
	•	“Proceed to production”
	•	or “Proceed to production with known limitations”
	•	or “Do not release”

⸻

Important

This is the final gate before Play Store production.
Your role is judge, not implementer.
