Replace/extend the current implementation to make Custom work consistently across Android + PWA + iOS with the same meaning: system-managed notification sound. Follow these instructions EXACTLY.

NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARDRAILS
	•	DO NOT change capacitor appId, Android applicationId/packageName, or any native identifiers.
	•	DO NOT clear, reset, migrate-by-wiping, or otherwise modify user data in IndexedDB/localStorage.
	•	DO NOT delete/recreate user alerts/notes/notifications data structures.
	•	DO NOT refactor or change ANY alert logic (repeat logic, scheduling rules, UTC/local conversion, enabling/disabling, etc.).
	•	ONLY implement the platform-specific behavior for soundId="custom" + the minimal UI text/buttons described below.
	•	Keep existing soundId mapping: original|classic|chime|bell|ping|tone|custom.

GOAL

custom must remain selectable and visible in the sound picker on all platforms (Android, iOS, PWA).
Custom does NOT mean “upload/choose a file inside the app.”
It means: use the system-managed notification sound.

A) UI REQUIREMENTS (All platforms)
	1.	In the sound picker list, keep Custom as a normal selectable option (NOT disabled, NOT hidden) on Android + iOS + PWA.
	2.	For the Custom row:
	•	NO preview/play button.
	•	Show a short description text:
	•	Android: Choose in Android notification settings.
	•	iOS: Sound is managed by iOS system settings.
	•	PWA: Sound is managed by your browser/system.
	3.	Selecting Custom must save soundId="custom" using the existing storage mechanism/key (do not change schema; if missing, default remains original).

B) ANDROID BEHAVIOR (Required)
	1.	Notifications scheduled with soundId="custom" must use the Custom notification channel (keep your existing versioned channel approach):
	•	channelId: alerts_custom_v2 (or your current custom channel ID if already implemented as v2).
	•	The Custom channel must have NO sound set in code (system-managed).
	2.	Add a Settings button visible ONLY on Android:
	•	Label: Open Android Notification Settings (Custom)
	•	Action: open the app’s Android notification settings screen (best effort deep-link to the app notifications; channel deep-link is optional).
	•	If channel deep-link is not available, open general app notification settings.
	3.	IMPORTANT: Do not change any other scheduling logic. Only ensure channelId mapping is applied consistently when scheduling.

C) PWA BEHAVIOR (Required)
	1.	Keep Custom selectable and saved as soundId="custom".
	2.	Do NOT attempt any channel logic or custom audio for notifications (web limitations).
	3.	Do NOT show any “Open settings” button. Only show the descriptive text in the picker.
	4.	Do NOT change any notification logic beyond keeping custom as a supported value.

D) iOS BEHAVIOR (Required)
	1.	Keep Custom selectable and saved as soundId="custom".
	2.	Do NOT attempt to upload/select a file. Do NOT add new native plugins.
	3.	Do NOT show any “Open settings” button. Only show the descriptive text in the picker.
	4.	Notifications for custom should behave as “system default sound” (no special sound handling).

E) DATA SAFETY
	•	Do not modify stored alerts/notes records. Do not rewrite existing objects.
	•	If any existing alert lacks soundId, treat it as original at runtime (do not backfill by rewriting all records).

F) DELIVERABLES
	1.	List the exact files changed and why.
	2.	Provide test steps:
	•	Android: select Custom → open settings button → set channel sound → schedule alert → verify sound follows system selection.
	•	PWA: select Custom → schedule alert → verify it uses browser/system sound (no preview).
	•	iOS: select Custom → schedule alert → verify it uses iOS-managed/default sound (no preview).

REMINDER: Any change outside the scope above is a failure. Do not refactor unrelated code.
