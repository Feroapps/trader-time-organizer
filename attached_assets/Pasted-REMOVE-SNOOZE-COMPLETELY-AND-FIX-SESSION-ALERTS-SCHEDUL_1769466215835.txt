REMOVE SNOOZE COMPLETELY AND FIX SESSION ALERTS SCHEDULING.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT change file paths.
- Do NOT change package name.
- Do NOT add new features.
- Only remove snooze everywhere and ensure session (fixed) alerts are scheduled too.
- Output the FULL updated content of every file you modify.

========================================================
A) REMOVE SNOOZE FROM THE APP (END-TO-END)

1) Update Type(s):
FILE: client/src/types/Alarm.ts
- Remove snoozeMinutes from Alarm and any related types/interfaces (CreateAlarmInput if present).
- Ensure the app compiles after removal.

2) Remove snooze from UI:
FILE: client/src/components/AlertModal.tsx
- Remove any snooze UI (60/120/180, 5/10/15, etc) completely.
- Do NOT render snooze controls.
- Do NOT store snoozeMinutes in the created alarm input.
- Keep all other fields unchanged.

3) Remove snooze from storage:
FILE: client/src/storage/alarmsRepo.ts
- Ensure createAlarm no longer expects/handles snoozeMinutes.
- Keep: await scheduleAlarmNotification(newAlarm); (already present)

4) Remove snooze from scheduling layer:
FILE: client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts
- Remove any DEFAULT_SNOOZE_MINUTES usage.
- When calling scheduleUserAlarmNative(...) on Android, pass a constant 0 for snoozeMinutes (or remove parameter if you also update the wrapper).
- Make sure the code compiles.

5) Remove snooze from Android plugin bridge (TypeScript):
FILE: client/src/utils/userAlarmPlugin.ts
- Remove snoozeMinutes from the UserAlarmPlugin TypeScript interface and from scheduleUserAlarmNative() signature.
- scheduleUserAlarmNative should call UserAlarm.scheduleAlarm with:
  { alarmId, label, triggerTimeMs, soundId }
- Update cancel/stop methods unchanged.
- Make sure compilation passes.

6) Adjust Android plugin to accept no snooze:
FILE: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/UserAlarmPlugin.java
- In scheduleAlarm(...), treat snoozeMinutes as optional and IGNORE it (or remove reading it).
- The method must still schedule exactly one alarm via AlarmManager.
- cancelAlarm should remain for alarmId only.
- Keep explicit { success: true/false } responses and logging.

========================================================
B) USER-CREATED ALARMS RING FOR 120s UNLESS USER STOPS (NO SNOOZE)
FILE: android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/AlarmSoundService.java
- Ensure it rings up to 120 seconds (ALARM_TIMEOUT_MS=120000) OR until STOP is pressed.
- Do NOT implement any snooze behavior.
(If already correct, do not change it.)

========================================================
C) FIX SESSION/FIXED ALERTS (THEY ALSO WERE NOT WORKING)
CURRENT ISSUE: rescheduleAllAlarms excludes fixed alarms.
We must reschedule ALL enabled alarms on native resume/init, including fixed session alerts.

FILE: client/src/utils/nativeNotifications.ts
- Update rescheduleAllAlarms() so it schedules ALL alarms that are enabled, INCLUDING isFixed=true.
- It must iterate alarms.filter(a => a.isEnabled) (no isFixed exclusion).
- For each alarm: await scheduleAlarmNotification(alarm)

FILE: client/src/utils/capacitorInit.ts (or wherever rescheduleAllAlarms is called)
- Ensure rescheduleAllAlarms() is called on app resume/active (already) AND also once on initial native app start (if not already).
- Do NOT add new files; only adjust existing initialization minimally.

========================================================
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Print the FULL final content of each modified file.
- Do not explain.
- Do not add TODOs.
