STOP GUESSING. DO EXACTLY THIS AND REPORT RESULTS.

GOAL:
Fix Android custom Capacitor plugin registration for "UserAlarm" WITHOUT editing any generated files.

RULES:
- DO NOT edit android/capacitor.plugins.json (it is generated and will be overwritten).
- DO NOT propose random refactors.
- Only touch MainActivity.java and verify UserAlarmPlugin.java location/package.
- Output: (1) exact file paths found, (2) exact final content of MainActivity.java, (3) a short verification checklist.

STEP 1 — LOCATE FILES (MANDATORY):
Search the repo and PRINT the exact paths:
- All MainActivity.java files (there may be multiple).
- The UserAlarmPlugin.java file.
Also print the first line (package line) of each file you found.

STEP 2 — VERIFY PACKAGE CONSISTENCY:
Confirm these are IDENTICAL across MainActivity.java and UserAlarmPlugin.java:
- package line (e.g. package com.feroapps.tradertime;)
- appId / applicationId in android/app/build.gradle (print applicationId line).
If mismatch exists, fix by aligning package declarations to the applicationId package.

STEP 3 — APPLY REGISTRATION (ONLY IN THE REAL MAINACTIVITY USED BY THE APP):
In the MainActivity.java that matches the applicationId package and resides under:
android/app/src/main/java/<package_path>/MainActivity.java
Set EXACT content to:

package com.feroapps.tradertime;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import com.getcapacitor.BridgeActivity;

public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    Log.i("MainActivity", "MainActivity.onCreate - registering UserAlarmPlugin");
    registerPlugin(UserAlarmPlugin.class);
  }
}

Do NOT change anything else.

STEP 4 — VERIFY THE PLUGIN CLASS:
Ensure UserAlarmPlugin.java is at:
android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/UserAlarmPlugin.java
and starts with:
package com.feroapps.tradertime;

STEP 5 — SYNC COMMANDS (REPORT ONLY, DO NOT RUN HERE):
From project root, user will run:
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android

STEP 6 — LOGCAT PROOF REQUIRED:
In Logcat, user must see:
"MainActivity.onCreate - registering UserAlarmPlugin"
If not visible, it means edits were applied to the WRONG MainActivity.java path.
Explain which path is wrong and which is correct based on STEP 1 results.

NOW DO STEP 1-4 AND PRINT RESULTS.
