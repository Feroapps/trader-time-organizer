ROLE: You are Replit Agent working inside the existing trader-time-organizer codebase.
GOAL: Diagnose why the two buttons in the Alert Sound / sound library UI do not open any Android settings, WITHOUT modifying any code.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT edit, add, or delete any files.
- Do NOT run formatting.
- Do NOT refactor.
- Only inspect and report.
- Output MUST be a diagnostic report with exact file paths, function names, and the onClick/handler chain.

TASKS:
1) Locate the two buttons by their visible labels (or closest matches):
   - "Open Android Alarm Sound Settings"
   - "Open Battery Optimization Settings"
   If labels differ, report the exact current labels found.

2) For each button, trace the full execution path:
   UI component -> onClick handler -> any helper function -> any Capacitor/Android bridge call -> final platform action (intent / openAppSettings / Browser.open / window.open).
   Provide:
   - file path(s)
   - line numbers (approx ok)
   - exact function names
   - any conditions/guards (platform checks, isNative checks, feature flags, disabled state, early returns)

3) Determine why they "do nothing" on Android:
   Check and report any of these causes:
   - handler not wired (onClick missing, wrong prop, wrong component)
   - handler runs but exits early (platform guard, permission guard, try/catch swallowing)
   - call uses web-only method (window.open) inside WebView
   - uses Browser.open with non-http URL
   - uses AppLauncher/App.openAppSettings incorrectly or not installed/imported
   - calls a missing native plugin or wrong plugin name
   - runtime error thrown (silent) — search for console.error/logcat hints in code
   - buttons are disabled/covered by overlay/scroll container (pointer-events none)

4) Provide a verification checklist WITHOUT code changes:
   - exact place(s) to add temporary logs (but do not add them)
   - how to confirm handler is firing (where to look in console/logcat)
   - what the expected platform API should be for Android settings (Intent vs App.openAppSettings)

DELIVERABLE:
Return a structured report:

A) Where the buttons are defined (paths + snippet references)
B) Click-path trace for Button #1
C) Click-path trace for Button #2
D) Most likely root cause(s) ranked (with evidence)
E) Minimal fix options (DESCRIBE ONLY, do not apply)
