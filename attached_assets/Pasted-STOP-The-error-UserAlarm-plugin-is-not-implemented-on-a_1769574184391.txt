STOP. The error `"UserAlarm" plugin is not implemented on android` means the native plugin is NOT being loaded at all.
This is NOT an AlarmManager / Doze / device issue. It is 100% plugin registration/build integration.

ABSOLUTE RULE:
- DO NOT edit `android/app/src/main/assets/capacitor.plugins.json` (or any capacitor.plugins.json). It is AUTO-GENERATED and WILL DELETE manual entries.
- Your custom plugin MUST be compiled as native source and registered by MainActivity (or auto-registered by Capacitor), not by JSON.

DO THIS EXACTLY:

1) REMOVE any manual "UserAlarm" entry from any `capacitor.plugins.json` / `capacitor.plugins` file. Never edit it again.

2) VERIFY plugin file exists at EXACT path:
   android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/UserAlarmPlugin.java

   AND it contains:
   @CapacitorPlugin(name = "UserAlarm")
   public class UserAlarmPlugin extends Plugin { ... }

3) VERIFY MainActivity registers the plugin (this is REQUIRED for app-local plugins):
   android/app/src/main/java/com/feroapps/tradertime/MainActivity.java

   Use EXACT code:
   package com.feroapps.tradertime;

   import android.os.Bundle;
   import com.getcapacitor.BridgeActivity;

   public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
     @Override
     protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
       registerPlugin(UserAlarmPlugin.class);
     }
   }

4) HARD CLEAN + RESYNC from PROJECT ROOT (where package.json + capacitor.config.ts exist):
   npm run build
   npx cap sync android

5) UNINSTALL the app from the emulator/device (to avoid stale cached plugin lists):
   adb uninstall com.feroapps.tradertime

6) Re-open Android and run:
   npx cap open android
   Then Run in Android Studio.

EXPECTED RESULT:
- The `"UserAlarm" plugin is not implemented on android` error MUST disappear.
IF it still appears after uninstall + clean sync, you are building/running a different Android project than the one you edited (wrong folder opened) OR the plugin is not actually inside android/app/src/main/java.

DO NOT mention WorkManager. Fix plugin loading first.
