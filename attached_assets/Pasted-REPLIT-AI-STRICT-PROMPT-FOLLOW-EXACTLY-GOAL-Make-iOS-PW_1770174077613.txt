REPLIT AI — STRICT PROMPT. FOLLOW EXACTLY.

GOAL:
Make iOS + PWA use the SAME Settings options + UI flow that Android currently has,
WITHOUT changing ANY Android behavior or Android files.
After changes, you MUST output an exact change report so we can verify.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
1) DO NOT modify anything inside:
   - android/ (entire folder)  ✅ NO CHANGES AT ALL
2) DO NOT change any existing business logic for alarms, schedules, sessions, ads, or routing.
3) DO NOT refactor, rename, reorganize folders, or auto-format across the project.
4) ONLY add the minimum required iOS + PWA glue so the same Settings/UX appears consistently.
5) If something is already working via shared React code, DO NOT touch it.

WHAT “GENERALIZE ANDROID SETTINGS/UI TO iOS + PWA” MEANS (STRICT):
A) iOS build should run (Capacitor iOS platform created) without code changes to Android.
B) PWA should show the same Settings items + screens + toggles currently shown on Android.
C) Any Android-only native features must have SAFE fallbacks on iOS/PWA:
   - UserAlarm native plugin: iOS already uses LocalNotifications path; PWA should not crash.
   - Fixed sessions: iOS/PWA use LocalNotifications (or existing TS scheduling) where already implemented.
   - Rewarded ads: keep existing fallback/stub for iOS/PWA if real iOS ads are not implemented.

TASKS (DO IN ORDER):

STEP 1) Create iOS platform WITHOUT touching android/
- Ensure @capacitor/ios is installed (only if missing).
- Run:
  npx cap add ios
- Run:
  npx cap sync ios
IMPORTANT: Do NOT run cap sync android. Do NOT edit anything under android/.

STEP 2) Verify platform guards prevent crashes on iOS/PWA
- Search for any direct native calls that might run on startup without platform checks.
- Ensure all calls to:
  scheduleUserAlarmNative / cancelUserAlarmNative / canScheduleExactAlarmsNative
  are protected by isAndroidNative() (or equivalent) so iOS/PWA never call Android plugins.
- If any missing guard exists, add ONLY the minimal guard (one if-statement) in the SAME file.
- Do not change logic; only prevent calling Android plugins on iOS/PWA.

STEP 3) Ensure Settings UI is shared for Android/iOS/PWA
- Identify the Settings screen/component used on Android.
- Confirm the same component is used for iOS + PWA builds (no platform-specific alternate UI).
- If there is any “Android only” conditional hiding Settings items on iOS/PWA, remove ONLY the UI-hiding condition,
  but keep the action behavior safe (e.g., button still visible but uses safe fallback on non-Android).
- Do NOT add new settings. Do NOT remove settings.

STEP 4) Output a STRICT change report (MANDATORY)
Return ONLY:
1) A list of files CHANGED (exact paths)
2) A list of files CREATED (exact paths)
3) For each CHANGED file: show the exact before/after code lines (diff-style or clearly separated)
4) Confirm explicitly: "NO FILES UNDER android/ WERE MODIFIED."

DO NOT:
- Provide explanations or recommendations.
- Add future work notes.
- Change Android, scheduling rules, or UI design.
- Add ads implementation for iOS.

START NOW. FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.
