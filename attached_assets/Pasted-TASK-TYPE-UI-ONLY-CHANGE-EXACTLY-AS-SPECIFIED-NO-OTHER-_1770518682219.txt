TASK TYPE: UI-ONLY CHANGE (EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED) — NO OTHER CHANGES

GOAL:
Add a separate red ❗️ icon button NEXT TO the existing "+ Add Alert" button (same row, same level). The Add Alert button must remain unchanged. The ❗️ must be clickable independently and must NOT trigger Add Alert when pressed. On click, the ❗️ opens an in-app dialog (English only) explaining battery/background requirements for reliable alarms. This must appear on Android, iOS, and PWA.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change any alarm logic, scheduling, notifications, storage, or native code.
- Do NOT change the existing Add Alert button text, styling, or onClick behavior.
- ONLY add the new ❗️ button beside it and the dialog UI.
- English only.
- No opening Android settings, no intents, no Capacitor calls.
- Ensure clicks do not overlap: pressing ❗️ must NOT trigger Add Alert (use stopPropagation).

WHERE:
File: client/src/screens/Home.tsx (or the exact file where the "+ Add Alert" button in the Home screen is implemented).

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
1) Wrap the existing "+ Add Alert" button and the new ❗️ button in:
   <div className="flex items-center gap-2"> ... </div>

2) Keep the existing Add Alert button exactly as-is (same component, props, handler).
   - You may add className="flex-1" ONLY if it does not change existing layout negatively. Otherwise leave it unchanged.

3) Add a separate ❗️ button to the right:
   - Size: 40x40 (w-10 h-10), rounded-md
   - Red background (destructive) or red text, but clearly visible
   - Uses "❗️" character (no lucide icon required)
   - Has onClick(e) { e.stopPropagation(); } to prevent triggering Add Alert

4) On clicking ❗️, open an in-app dialog (English only) with:
   Title: "Important"
   Body:
   "For alarms to work reliably, please allow the app to run in the background and disable battery optimization."

Use the existing dialog system already in the project (Dialog/AlertDialog from shadcn UI). Do NOT introduce new libraries.

DELIVERABLE:
- Paste ONLY the final modified JSX block around "+ Add Alert" showing the new ❗️ button and the dialog.
- Confirm the file path changed and that no other files were modified.
