You are working on a Capacitor Android app (WebView). Problem: On Android ONLY, the soft keyboard does NOT appear and text input is impossible inside our modal dialogs:
- Cannot type in Note textarea (NoteModal)
- Cannot change alert label (AlertModal)
PWA works fine. Android native build is broken. This worked in a previous Android build. No phone settings changes.

IMPORTANT: We already tried adding android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize" on MainActivity in android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml and it did NOT fix the issue. So do NOT repeat this fix.

STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
1) INVESTIGATE FIRST. Do NOT change any code until you produce an investigation report with concrete evidence.
2) Confirm the exact failure mechanism on Android WebView (Capacitor) that prevents the keyboard from showing.
3) Use code-level evidence + Android-side evidence. Identify whether:
   - WebView is not focusable / losing focus immediately
   - WindowInsets / edge-to-edge / system bars configuration breaks IME
   - Modal overlay blocks touches/focus
   - Capacitor WebView input mode / Keyboard plugin missing
   - Activity config (launchMode, configChanges, theme) causes IME not to attach
4) Provide a short “Root Cause” section with a definitive statement (no vague guesses).
5) Then apply the minimal fix that ONLY targets Android native (must not change PWA behavior).
6) Provide a STRICT CHANGE REPORT:
   - List every file changed
   - Show exact code diffs
   - Explain why this fix solves the Android keyboard issue
   - Confirm no unrelated changes were made

WHAT YOU MUST CHECK (MANDATORY):
- android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (MainActivity config, theme, windowSoftInputMode already tried)
- android/app/src/main/java/**/MainActivity.java (any WebView / edge-to-edge / window flags)
- styles.xml / themes (AppTheme.NoActionBarLaunch) for windowSoftInputMode or translucent/adjustPan behavior
- Capacitor version and whether @capacitor/keyboard is installed/needed
- Any code that sets viewport/overscroll/insets or uses StatusBar/NavigationBar plugins
- Whether Dialog/Overlay prevents focus on Android (test/confirm by temporarily logging focus events)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change UI/UX.
- Do NOT change Radix dialog behavior for PWA.
- Do NOT introduce new dependencies unless absolutely required.
- If you propose installing @capacitor/keyboard, justify with evidence and keep changes minimal.

Deliverables:
A) Investigation report (bullet points, evidence-based)
B) One minimal fix
C) Strict change report (diffs + explanation)
