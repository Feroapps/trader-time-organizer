STRICT DEBUGGING PROMPT — ANDROID INPUT ISSUE (ANALYSIS ONLY)

You must ONLY ANALYZE the problem first.
❌ Do NOT apply fixes
❌ Do NOT refactor code
❌ Do NOT suggest multiple solutions yet

⸻

PROBLEM STATEMENT

On Android (Capacitor build only):
	•	The virtual keyboard does NOT allow typing
	•	User cannot type in Note textarea
	•	User cannot edit the Alert label (name)
	•	Inputs visually receive focus, but no text can be entered
	•	PWA version works perfectly
	•	Previous Android version worked (no phone settings were changed)
	•	Issue affects multiple inputs across different modals

This is NOT a language / locale / keyboard setting issue.

⸻

AFFECTED COMPONENTS
	•	AlertModal.tsx
	•	<Input /> for alert label (user cannot change name)
	•	NoteModal.tsx
	•	<Textarea /> for notes (user cannot type)

Both are rendered inside Radix Dialog (shadcn/ui).

⸻

CONSTRAINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
	•	❌ No changes to phone settings
	•	❌ No assumptions like “user didn’t test Android before”
	•	❌ Do NOT blame user environment
	•	❌ Do NOT propose generic fixes yet
	•	❌ Do NOT touch unrelated files

⸻

CONTEXT
	•	PWA (browser) → ✅ Works
	•	Android Capacitor (WebView) → ❌ Broken
	•	No recent changes to:
	•	AlertModal
	•	NoteModal
	•	dialog.tsx (before attempted fixes)
	•	index.css (no pointer-events on inputs)
	•	AndroidManifest.xml tested with:
	•	windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize" → ❌ did NOT fix

⸻

YOUR TASK (ANALYSIS ONLY)
	1.	Identify the REAL root cause of:
	•	Keyboard appearing but not typing
	•	Input focus without text entry
	•	Affecting ALL Radix Dialog inputs on Android
	2.	Verify:
	•	Radix Dialog focus trap behavior on Android WebView
	•	Capacitor WebView + focus/IME interaction
	•	Any known Android WebView regressions
	•	Whether MainActivity / WebView config can block IME input
	•	Whether Ads / plugins can steal focus
	3.	Clearly state:
	•	What EXACT mechanism is blocking typing
	•	Why it affects Android only
	•	Why PWA is not affected
	4.	DO NOT APPLY FIXES YET
	•	End response with: “Root cause identified. Ready to apply minimal fix.”

⸻

FAILURE CONDITIONS (DO NOT DO THESE)
	•	❌ Giving multiple guesses
	•	❌ Saying “try X and see”
	•	❌ Refactoring Dialog without explanation
	•	❌ Adding keyboard plugins without justification
	•	❌ Long generic Android explanations

You are debugging a production-blocking Android input issue.
Be precise, technical, and deterministic.
