STRICT MODE — REQUEST INFORMATION ONLY (NO CODE CHANGES, NO FIXES)

Project: Trader Time Organizer (Capacitor + React/Vite + Android native)

Context:
We ran a full investigation and identified several POTENTIAL issues, but before applying ANY fix, we need VERIFIED EVIDENCE from the codebase.

DO NOT modify, refactor, format, or fix anything.
DO NOT add try/catch, permissions, or logic.
DO NOT suggest fixes yet.

Your task is ONLY to COLLECT and REPORT the following information with exact code excerpts and file paths.

========================
A) AlarmActivity — Receiver & Foreground Service
========================
1) Open `android/app/src/main/java/**/AlarmActivity.java`
   - Is there a `BroadcastReceiver` (e.g. finishReceiver)?
   - If YES:
     • Show where it is DECLARED
     • Show where it is REGISTERED (registerReceiver / LocalBroadcastManager)
     • Show where it is UNREGISTERED
   - If NOT registered anywhere, explicitly state: "Receiver exists but is never registered" OR "No receiver exists".

2) In the SAME file:
   - Locate ANY call to `startForegroundService(...)`
   - Provide exact line numbers and surrounding code (±5 lines)
   - Confirm whether it is wrapped in try/catch or not

========================
B) TypeScript dateUTC Errors — Data Assumptions
========================
1) Open:
   - `client/src/screens/Calendar.tsx`
   - `client/src/screens/DayView.tsx`

For each reported error:
   - Show the exact code lines where `alarm.dateUTC` or `a.dateUTC` is used
   - Confirm ALL code paths that lead to these components:
     • Are Session Alerts (repeatDays-based) ever passed here?
     • Are there guards like `isFixed` or `type === 'user'`?

2) Open the Alarm type definition:
   - File where `Alarm` interface/type is defined
   - Show exact definition of `dateUTC`
   - Confirm whether runtime data guarantees `dateUTC` for user alarms

========================
C) Android Resources — Crash Verification
========================
Verify existence of the following resources by listing actual files:
   - `R.drawable.ic_stat_notification`
   - `R.drawable.ic_notification_large`
   - `R.mipmap.ic_stat_notification1`
   - `R.layout.activity_alarm`

For each:
   - Confirm file path (e.g. android/app/src/main/res/drawable/...)
   - Or explicitly state "RESOURCE NOT FOUND"

========================
D) Ads / GDPR — Evidence Check
========================
1) Search the codebase for:
   - UMP SDK
   - Consent dialogs
   - Any AdMob consent logic

2) Report:
   - Whether ads are shown unconditionally
   - Whether EEA/GDPR handling exists or not
   - Do NOT suggest solutions yet

========================
E) Output Requirements
========================
- Provide ONLY findings and code excerpts
- NO fixes
- NO recommendations
- NO assumptions
- If something cannot be proven, mark it clearly as UNCONFIRMED

End the report with:
"NO FILES WERE MODIFIED DURING THIS INVESTIGATION."
