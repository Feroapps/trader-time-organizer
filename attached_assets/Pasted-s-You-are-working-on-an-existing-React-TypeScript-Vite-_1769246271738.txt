You are working on an existing React + TypeScript + Vite + Capacitor project called Trader Time Organizer.  
This is a single shared codebase.  
Apply ALL changes exactly as described.  
Do NOT change any time calculation logic.  
Do NOT invent new features.

---

## 1. Home Screen – Mobile Typography Fix

- On mobile screens only:
  - Reduce font size of:
    - “Local Time” title
    - “UTC Time” title
    - The displayed time values
- Use responsive typography (media queries or clamp).
- Goal:
  - Free horizontal space so session names are fully visible.
- Desktop layout must remain unchanged.

---

## 2. Android App Icon (Capacitor)

- Android app icon must match the PWA icon visually.
- Do NOT manually edit Android mipmap folders.
- Use an automated solution (Capacitor assets generator).
- Use one high-quality square source icon.
- Regenerate Android adaptive icons and sync the project.
- Result:
  - Android launcher icon = PWA icon.

---

## 3. Android Status Bar & Navigation Bar

- Remove black bars at the top and bottom on Android.
- Status Bar and Navigation Bar must blend with the app UI:
  - Light mode → white / light background
  - Dark mode → app dark background
- No black gaps when swiping or resizing.
- Use proper Android theme and window configuration.

---

## 4. Alert System – Complete Redesign

### 4.1 General Rules
- Remove Enabled switch completely.
- Alerts are always saved when pressing Save.
- Alerts can be deleted only from:
  - Calendar
  - Alerts list / Settings
- When deleting:
  - Show confirmation dialog: “Are you sure?”
  - On confirm:
    - Delete alert
    - Cancel the related local notification

---

### 4.2 Alert Model
- Base alert = Date + Time
- Optional repeat:
  - Repeat Weekly → same weekday
  - Repeat Monthly → same day of month
- Repeats are indefinite until deleted.
- No “repeat once”.
- No separate alert modes.

---

### 4.3 Alert UI (Add / Edit)
- Fields:
  1. Date picker
  2. Time picker
  3. Repeat options:
     - ☐ Repeat weekly
     - ☐ Repeat monthly
- Repeat day is derived automatically from selected date.
- No weekday selector.
- No Enabled toggle.

---

### 4.4 Notifications
- Use Local Notifications only.
- No Web Push.
- Android is the reference platform.
- On Save:
  - Schedule next occurrence.
- On trigger:
  - If repeating → reschedule next occurrence.
- On Delete:
  - Cancel notification immediately.
- PWA is UI preview only.

---

## 5. Alert Indicators on Time Rulers

### UTC Ruler
- Alert indicators remain visible.
- Color is always black in both light and dark mode.
- Purpose: avoid collision with session colors.

### Local Time Ruler
- Indicators are shown after converting UTC → local time.
- Colors:
  - Light mode → black
  - Dark mode → white
- No fluorescent colors.

---

## 6. Alert Sounds

- Add a library of exactly 5 alert sounds.
- In Settings:
  - Allow selecting the sound.
  - Optional in-app preview.
- Do NOT add volume controls.
- App uses device / notification channel volume.
- Android:
  - Sounds must work with Local Notifications.

---

## 7. Hour Labels on Mobile (Local & UTC Rulers)

- On mobile screens only:
  - Show hour numbers every 2 hours.
  - Apply a staggered vertical layout:
    - One label slightly higher
    - Next label slightly lower
    - Alternating pattern
- Applies to:
  - Local Time ruler
  - UTC Time ruler
- This is visual only:
  - Do NOT modify time logic.
- Desktop remains unchanged.

---

## 8. Global Rules

- One shared codebase.
- Any UI or logic change applies to both PWA and Android.
- UI can be previewed on PWA.
- Functional validation (alerts, notifications) is done on Android.
- Do NOT add extra features.
