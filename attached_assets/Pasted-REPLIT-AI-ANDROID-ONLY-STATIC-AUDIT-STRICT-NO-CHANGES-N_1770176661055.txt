REPLIT AI — ANDROID-ONLY STATIC AUDIT (STRICT). NO CHANGES, NO COMMANDS.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- DO NOT modify, create, delete, or format ANY file.
- DO NOT run any commands (NO npm, NO gradle, NO cap sync, NO build, NO install).
- DO NOT propose fixes as code edits.
- ANALYSIS ONLY: identify risks, failure scenarios, and likely runtime errors.

SCOPE:
ANDROID ONLY.
Ignore iOS and PWA completely.
Focus on the native Android runtime behavior + Capacitor bridge + local plugins + AlarmManager + notifications.

WHAT YOU MUST ANALYZE:
1) App launch stability on CLEAN INSTALL from Play Store (release AAB)
2) Capacitor plugin registration + discovery:
   - MainActivity registration order and implications
   - Local plugins (UserAlarmPlugin, RewardedAdsPlugin, FixedSessionScheduler)
3) Exact alarms behavior across Android versions:
   - Android 12/13/14/15 (API 31+)
   - canScheduleExactAlarms() permission behavior
   - Failure modes if permission denied/revoked
4) Foreground service constraints:
   - AlarmSoundService startForeground timing and required types
   - Background start restrictions
5) Notification behavior:
   - channel creation, importance, sound mapping
   - icon resources (drawable vs mipmap)
   - duplicate notification risks (TS scheduling vs native scheduling)
6) Boot and rescheduling:
   - Boot receivers, quickboot actions, timing issues after boot
   - Data availability (SharedPreferences vs IndexedDB/localforage)
7) OEM restrictions risks (Samsung/Xiaomi/Huawei etc.):
   - battery optimization, autostart, background restrictions
   - what breaks and how it appears to users
8) Logging and crash signatures:
   - likely exceptions (SecurityException, IllegalStateException, ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException, etc.)
   - where they would happen (file + method)

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
SECTION A — ZERO-RISK CONFIRMED AREAS (Android)
(list files/components that are clearly safe)

SECTION B — HIGH-RISK AREAS (Android)
For each item:
- File path
- Class / method
- Exact reason
- Likely exception name (if any)
- User-visible symptom (e.g., opens then closes, alarm delayed, no sound, notification missing)

SECTION C — MEDIUM-RISK AREAS (Android)
(same structure as Section B)

SECTION D — DUPLICATE/DOUBLE-NOTIFICATION CHECK
- Explain whether fixed sessions can fire twice (native + TS)
- Explain whether user alarms can fire twice
- Identify the exact points where duplication could occur

SECTION E — PLAY STORE RELEASE RISKS
- Anything that behaves differently in release vs debug
- Anything that depends on clean rebuild / cached artifacts

SECTION F — TOP 5 FAILURE SCENARIOS (Android)
Write 5 concrete scenarios:
- device type / Android version
- steps user does
- what breaks
- likely root cause location

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT include code changes or code blocks.
- Do NOT suggest “fix by doing X”.
- ONLY report risks and expected error patterns.
