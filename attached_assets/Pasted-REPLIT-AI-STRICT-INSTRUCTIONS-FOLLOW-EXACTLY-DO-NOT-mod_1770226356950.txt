REPLIT AI — STRICT INSTRUCTIONS (FOLLOW EXACTLY)

DO NOT modify any file.
DO NOT run any refactor/format/cleanup.
DO NOT add packages.
DO NOT commit changes.
ONLY investigate, reproduce, and report evidence.

BUG TO VERIFY (Android Native ONLY):
- In Capacitor Android build: inside Dialog modals (AlertModal + NoteModal), keyboard may appear but typing does NOT work.
- PWA works normally.
- Symptoms:
  1) Cannot type in Note text area (NoteModal).
  2) Cannot edit user alarm label/name input (AlertModal).
- It used to work in a previous build (user claim), now broken in Android native.

PROJECT FILES TO FOCUS ON:
- client/src/components/AlertModal.tsx
- client/src/components/NoteModal.tsx
- client/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx
- Any Radix/shadcn Dialog wrapper used by these modals

WHAT YOU MUST DO:
1) Reproduce (or simulate) as close as possible:
   - Assume Android WebView/Capacitor environment.
   - Identify if the issue can be reproduced by running Android build OR by reasoned analysis of Radix focus trap + WebView.
2) Confirm whether Radix Dialog FocusScope "trapFocus" is the root cause on Android WebView:
   - Look for trapFocus default behavior in Dialog implementation.
   - Check if focus is being stolen during IME/keyboard activation.
3) Provide HARD EVIDENCE from codebase:
   - Quote exact code lines where Dialog enables focus trap.
   - Quote exact lines in our dialog wrapper and whether we pass trapFocus / onOpenAutoFocus / onCloseAutoFocus.
   - Mention Radix version(s) from package.json / lockfile.
4) Provide a STRICT DIAGNOSIS with high confidence:
   - “Root cause confirmed” or “Root cause not confirmed”
   - If confirmed, explain the exact mechanism in 3–6 bullet points max.
5) Provide a MINIMAL FIX PLAN (do not apply it):
   - Option A: disable trapFocus ONLY on Android Native.
   - Option B: keep trapFocus but disable FocusScope trapping/auto focus differently (if applicable).
   - Mention which option is safest and why.
6) Provide a RISK CHECK:
   - What could break if we disable trapFocus on Android only?
   - Any accessibility or escape-key issues?
   - Any side effect on other dialogs?

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):
A) Repro Status: (Reproduced / Not Reproduced / Cannot Run — Code Evidence Only)
B) Confirmed Root Cause: (Yes/No) + one sentence
C) Evidence: list exact file paths + line ranges + snippets
D) Minimal Fix Options (NO CODE APPLIED)
E) Risk Assessment (short)

DO NOT include any code changes, diffs, or file edits.
ONLY analysis and report.
